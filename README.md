# star-wars
A proof-of-concept front-end web application to display Star Ways characters retrieved from the publicly available API 
(https://swapi.co/)

Configuration is handled with npm, NPM modules and local code.

To get started, git clone the project onto your local machine.

### Pre-requisites
  - Node version 12 (recommended) otherwise version 10 or 8
  - IDE (WebStorm, Sublime, VS Code...) supporting ESLint, EditorConfig, Syntax Highlighting for Vue, JS and SCSS files
  
### Technologies Used

 *The technologies being used are:*
 - JavaScript (ES6 / 2015) - code development
 - Vue JS - Single Page Application (SPA) development
 - Vue Router - All client side routing
 - Vuex -  State and Data management on client
 
 *Development Tools*
 - Babel - ES6, Modules, PolyFills, language features between environments
 - ESLint - Style and format checking for team / corporate code compliance
 - SCSS - Style sheet handling
 - Bootstrap - styling framework
 - JEST - Unit and Integration testing
 - Cypress - UI functionality and End to End testing (to be implemented)
 
#### Technology of Choice
I've chosen to develop this project using the VueJS framework because like other modern JavaScript frameworks (such as React),
VueJS has built in support for state management (via Vuex) allowing a single page web application to reactively change the content
on-screen as the data changes, without performing an entire page refresh.
React also has state management (with choices such as using Redux, or the newer Context API), however I've found projects in VueJS
extremely quick and easy to get off the ground for small projects, plus I'm currently working on large enterprise grade 
projects written in Vue, further making it easier for me to put a comprehensive project together in a relatively short timeframe.
